Title: push_button_sample

Description:

A sample to demonstrate the Push Button Interrupts (sensing edge detections + sleep wakeup) using the T-Mobile DevEdge dev kit

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements
************

-A T-Mobile DevEdge dev kit (https://devedge.t-mobile.com/)
-A Zephyr build environment (https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html)

Building and Running Project:

How this project can be built:

-Checkout the T-Mobile downstream zephyr repo:
	cd ~/zephyrproject
	git clone https://github.com/tmobile/DevEdge-IoTDevKit-ZephyrRTOS zephyr

-Checkout the T-Mobile zephyr-tmo-sdk repo:
	cd ~/zephyrproject
	git clone https://github.com/tmobile/DevEdge-IoTDevKit-ZephyrSDK tmo-zephyr-sdk

-Run 'west update'
	cd ~/zephyrproject
	west update

-Build this sample:
	cd ~/zephyrproject
	west build ~/zephyrproject/tmo-zephyr-sdk/samples/push_button_sample -p -b tmo_dev_edge
	(substitute your home folder for '<home folder>' in the command above)

-Connect DevEdge dev kit:
	Connect the USB-C port furthest from the pushbutton to your computer. (The
	other USB-C port can be connected; however, it's not used for this sample.)

-Flash push_button_sample:
	cd ~/zephyrproject
	west flash

Console output from the sample application follows:

                        Welcome to T-Mobile DevEdge!

This application aims to demonstrate the Gecko's Energy Mode 2 (EM2) (Deep
Sleep Mode) and Wake capabilities in conjunction with the SW0 interrupt pin,
which is connected to the user pushbutton switch of the DevEdge module.

Setting up GPIO
Set up button at gpio@4000a030 pin 13

Phase 1
In this phase, a firmware-based debounce filter cleans up the interrupt signal
generated by the user pushbutton switch. Momentarily pressing the pushbutton
will display the amount of time the button was pressed. Releasing the button
after holding it for more than three seconds will advance the demonstration to
the next and final phase.

Awaiting debounced user pushbutton interrupts...
Pushbutton press-event (duration: 181ms)
Pushbutton press-event (duration: 201ms)
Pushbutton press-event (duration: 382ms)
Pushbutton press-event (duration: 1326ms)
Pushbutton press-event (duration: 100ms)
Pushbutton press-event (duration: 2311ms)
Pushbutton press-event (duration: 2512ms)
Pushbutton press-event (duration: 2834ms)
Pushbutton press-event (duration: 2533ms)
Pushbutton press-event (duration: 3417ms)
Exiting phase 1

Phase 2
In this phase, the SW0 interrupt signal temporarily wakes the Gecko from EM2 to
print the signal's edge, rising or falling.
